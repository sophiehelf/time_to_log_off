# Time to Log Off
#### Python script that lets you tweet straight from your code editor because I literally never want to log into Twitter again lol. I might tweak this to be able to upload media at some point

##### How to use it

1) Create and set up a Twitter Developer account and get your API key and consumer secret. [Here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) are some good instructions.
2) Make sure your Python version is up-to-date and then install tweepy with pip install tweepy.
3) Clone this repo into whatever folder you want â€“ you won't need to run this from the terminal so it doesn't really matter which.
4) I highly recommend creating a config.py folder to hold your specific API and client keys and adding them to a .gitignore.
5) In the update_status function write out whatever tweet you want. 
6) Run the code straight from your text editor and check if the tweet posted. Yay :)
